This "game" has been made partly from the tutorial series "OpenGL 3D Game Tutorials" published on YouTube by ThinMatrix.

This code made from https://github.com/gruberchris/ThinMatrixGame which was to be a migration of ThinMatrix's tutorial game from LWJGL 2 to modern LWJGL 3.

## Keyboard Controls
* W is forward movement
* S is backward movement
* A is turn left
* D is turn right
* SPACE BAR is jump

Keyboard arrow keys also work for movement. 
~~Mouse input is buggy. Good luck!~~ 
Mouse input now fixed! Used left control + and move mouse to rotate the camera
Or use left control + middle mouse button (2) to reset the camera's angle

# ThinMatrix Game

This "game" is mostly the product of the tutorial series "OpenGL 3D Game Tutorials" published on YouTube by ThinMatrix.

This code was meant to be a migration of his tutorial game from LWJGL 2 to modern LWJGWL 3, but along the way, I have made customizations that either made sense to me or were just necessary as a consequence of porting his tutorial game to LWJGL 3.

Thank you, ThinMatrix for your fantastic tutorials and I hope everyone finds this ported code useful in understanding the OpenGL 4.5 API.

NOTE: Please notice that I have mostly made commits for each of the episodes in the tutorial series. I have done this so each lesson can be examined in detail by reverting the code to the desired lesson.

## Keyboard Controls
* W is forward movement
* S is backward movement
* A is turn left
* D is turn right
* SPACE BAR is jump
* PAGE UP is pitch camera upwards

Keyboard arrow keys also work for movement.

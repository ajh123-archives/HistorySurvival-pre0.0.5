## Where some of the code is from

This "game" has been made partly from the tutorial series "OpenGL 3D Game Tutorials" published on YouTube by ThinMatrix.

This code made from https://github.com/gruberchris/ThinMatrixGame which was to be a migration of ThinMatrix's tutorial game from LWJGL 2 to modern LWJGL 3.

## Keyboard Controls
* W is forward movement
* S is backward movement
* A is turn left
* D is turn right
* SPACE BAR is jump

Keyboard arrow keys also work for movement. 
~~Mouse input is buggy. Good luck!~~ 
Mouse input now fixed! Used left control + and move mouse to rotate the camera
Or use left control + middle mouse button (2) to reset the camera's angle

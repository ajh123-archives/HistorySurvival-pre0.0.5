This "game" is mostly the product of the tutorial series "OpenGL 3D Game Tutorials" published on YouTube by ThinMatrix.

This code was meant to be a migration of his tutorial game from LWJGL 2 to modern LWJGWL 3, but based of https://github.com/gruberchris/ThinMatrixGame as a starter.

## Keyboard Controls
* W is forward movement
* S is backward movement
* A is turn left
* D is turn right
* SPACE BAR is jump

Keyboard arrow keys also work for movement. 
~~Mouse input is buggy. Good luck!~~ 
Mouse input now fixed! Used left control + hold left/right click to rotate the camera
